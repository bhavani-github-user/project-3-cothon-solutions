# project-3-cothon-solutions

About the Project

This project was created as part of a learning experience in cloud computing and automation using AWS. It is designed to address the critical need for automated and reliable data backup systems, which are essential for disaster recovery and maintaining data integrity. By leveraging serverless computing and event-driven architecture, this solution demonstrates the power of AWS services in building cost-effective and scalable applications.

Why This Project Matters

1. Data Security: Ensures critical data is backed up securely in the cloud.


2. Automation: Eliminates the need for manual backups, reducing human error and saving time.


3. Cost-Efficiency: Uses serverless architecture (AWS Lambda), meaning you only pay for execution time.


4. Scalability: Easily extendable to accommodate larger datasets or more frequent backups.
